# Storex

Storex is a simply library that sets getters and setters on your state object and keep it in sync with WebStorage (currently localStorage only).

If you need your state to be synchronized with localStorage, Storex is the right library for you.

Storex will abstract all the direct usage of localStorage API and enable you to work with your state as you would normally do.
